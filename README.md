## Hi there ðŸ‘‹
### My name is David Honeman. I am going to school at SNHU. I live in Oregon, and go to school online. I like to code and hang out with friends. 
I am looking for peoeple to code with and bounce ideas off. I want to code any language. So anybody willing to teach me or needs a study partner. JavaScript is what I learned to code with and now moving into app.jsx so excited. Looks like a ton of typing, tons of learning-Im lost as shit acually. Function's are awesome, and wierd to start with.
